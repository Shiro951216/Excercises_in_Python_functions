# Excercises_in_Python_functions

I will be updating some Python excercises about functions, because i need to practice.
Feel free to comment any problem in the codes

PD. Sorry for bad english.

The excercises (for now) are:

* Factorization function
  
  Receive a positive integer number and return the canonic factorization showed by 2 lists: list of factors, and list of respective exponent.

* Credit Card Number Validation

  Validate an input by the following conditions:
  - Only 0-9 digits
  - Only have 16 digits
  - It can accept 4 groups of 4 digits separated only by '-' character, any other separator ('_','/') is not valid.
  - 4 identical digits consecutively are not accepted
